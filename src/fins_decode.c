 * bool XX_finslib_decode_address( const char *str, fins_address_tp *address );
 *
 * The function XX_finslib_decode_address() takes a character string as
 * argument and decodes it to an areaname address pair. The function skips
 * spaces and other obvious nonfunctional characters. On success the value
 * false is returned and true is returned when problems arise at the
 * conversion.
 *
 * Bit references must use the DOT notation, for example H82.1 to generate
 * the proper address. Some applications use a notation without a dot like
 * H8201, but this is not supported by this function.
